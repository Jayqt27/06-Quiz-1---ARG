1. Select the four (4) statements that can be inserted at line n1. (3 pts. each)
The four statements that can be inserted at line n1 are:
employee.salary = 50000;
director.salary = 80000;
employee.budget = 20000;
manager.budget = 100000;
These statements are all valid assignments to variables that are declared in the class definitions above. The other two statements, manager.stockOptions = 500; and
director.stockOptions = 1000;, cannot be inserted at line n1 because they are not in scope at that point in the program. The stockOptions variable is only declared in the
Director class, so it cannot be accessed before the Director object is created.
2. Will the code compile? If yes, determine the output. If no, state why. (3 pts.)
The code will compile and output: Pet
The Cat constructor calls the Pet constructor with an integer argument. However, because the Cat class doesn't have a Pet constructor, the code will simply call the
default constructor of the Pet class, which outputs "Pet".
